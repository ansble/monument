  - preparing for release of v1.4.9

  - Merge pull request #93 from ansble/bug/compressed-files
  - working closing #60
  - this is much more then the bug mentioned at this point (#60). It also includes a refactor of the startup process. Startup is now a set of functions invoked at startup. When they are complete they trigger an event that notifies the server that we are ready to go. Which is nice. In the future this will allow for user created startup tasks that can be passed in. Not there yet... but it's definitely possible now with a little work.
  - added a cleanup file and hooked it up in utils. It will contain all the tasks to be executed at shutdown of the server by default. The exposed task in the utils folder just executes all of the functions exposed by the cleanup module in sequence

  - Merge pull request #82 from ansble/feature/parser

  - have tests working for parser and can\'t replicate the multi firing. So I am guessing it is fixed. If it turns up later I\'ll reopen the issue and work on it. For now I\'m assuming that it is fixed and moving ahead

### - 1.4.9 *4/21/2015, 2:09:22 PM*

  - Merge pull request #94 from ansble/e3-harelbeke
  - Merge pull request #93 from ansble/bug/compressed-files
  - working closing #60
  - this is much more then the bug mentioned at this point (#60). It also includes a refactor of the startup process. Startup is now a set of functions invoked at startup. When they are complete they trigger an event that notifies the server that we are ready to go. Which is nice. In the future this will allow for user created startup tasks that can be passed in. Not there yet... but it's definitely possible now with a little work.
  - added a cleanup file and hooked it up in utils. It will contain all the tasks to be executed at shutdown of the server by default. The exposed task in the utils folder just executes all of the functions exposed by the cleanup module in sequence
